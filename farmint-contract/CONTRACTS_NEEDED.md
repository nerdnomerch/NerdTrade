## Recommendation: Use thirdweb SDK

For your Farcaster miniapp, I strongly recommend **thirdweb** because:

1. **Minimal Contract Code**: Pre-deployed, audited contracts
2. **Farcaster Integration**: Built-in support for social features
3. **Gasless Transactions**: Better UX for miniapp users
4. **Quick Launch**: 1-2 weeks vs 7-9 weeks custom
5. **Mobile Optimized**: Perfect for Farcaster mobile users

### thirdweb Implementation:
```typescript
// Frontend integration is just a few lines:
import { useContract, useNFTs, useCreateListing } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

// No custom contracts needed - use thirdweb's pre-deployed ones
const { contract } = useContract("YOUR_NFT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS");
const { contract: marketplace } = useContract("YOUR_MARKETPLACE_ADDRESS", "marketplace");
```

Would you like me to show you how to implement thirdweb integration?
